                    <p>
                        Over the past sixty years, a great body of knowledge has been built up on the subject of feedback control systems for linear, time-invariant, single input and single output dynamic systems. This knowledge plays an important
                        role in our technology. The primary aim of the designer using classical control design methods is to stabilize the system/plant, whereas secondary aims may involve obtaining a certain transient response, bandwidth,
                        disturbance rejection, steady state error, and robustness to plant variations or uncertainties. The designer’s methods are a combination of analytical ones (e.g., Laplace transform, Routh test), graphical ones (e.g., Nyquist
                        plots, Nichols charts), and a good deal of empirically based knowledge (e.g., a certain class of compensator works satisfactorily for a certain class of plants).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For higher-order systems, multiple-input systems, or systems that do not possess the properties usually assumed in the classical control approach (linear and time invariant), the techniques for analysis and design of linear,
                        time-invariant systems are, in general, not applicable to these more complicated systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the main aims of modern control is to present solutions to a much wider class of control problems than classical control can tackle by providing an array of analytical design procedures that facilitate the design
                        task.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Optimal control is one particular branch of modem control that sets out to design systems that are not supposed merely stable but satisfy, in the best possible way, any one of the desirable constraints associated with
                        classical control. The problem of optimal control can then be stated as: ”Determine the control signals that will cause a system to satisfy the physical constraints and, at the same time, minimize (or maximize) some
                        performance criterion”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After more than three hundred years of evolution of calculus of variations, optimal control has developed into a well-established research area and finds its applications in many scientific fields, ranging from mathematics
                        and engineering to biomedical and management sciences. As for modern control theory, despite the development of a vast body of knowledge and despite some spectacular applications to practical situations, some of the theory
                        has yet to find application, and many practical control problems have yet to find a theory that will successfully deal with them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In particular, from the theoretical point of view, the existence problem of an optimal control has still to be solved for many classes of problems. Note that solving this problem is of crucial importance, since it does not
                        make much sense to seek a solution if none exists.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another important topic is to actually find an optimal control, i.e., give a ’recipe’ for operating the system in such a way that it satisfies the constraints in an optimal manner. Such recipe should start from necessary
                        and/or sufficient conditions for optimality that are instrumental for identifying a small class of candidates for an optimal control. Unfortunately, these conditions are not available for some classes of problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, once a good candidate for an optimal control has been sorted out, it has to be computed. As most real-world problems are too complex to allow for an analytical solution, computational algorithms are inevitable in
                        solving optimal control problems. As a result, several successful families of algorithms have been developed over the years. Research is still going on in trying to speed up codes as well as in including special constraints
                        (e.g. integer constrains).

                    <p>The course aims at providing the students with all necessary tools for being able to apply the theory to practical optimal control design problems.</p>
                    <p>
                        Optimal control design is based on the designer’s familiarity with the engineering situation and understanding of the underlying physics. These allow to formulate a relevant mathematical model based on which the optimal control is
                        designed.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are four essential steps in an optimal control design:</p>

                    <ul class="itemize1">
                        <li class="itemize"><span class="cmti-10">full-state feedback design </span>where it is assumed that all states are measured and available for feedback;</li>
                        <li class="itemize"><span class="cmti-10">state estimator design </span>where the concern is to estimate values of the states when they cannot all be measured directly, but certain measurements are available;</li>
                        <li class="itemize">
                            <span class="cmti-10">controller reduction </span>where the concern is to approximate a complicated state estimate feedback controller obtained from the above two steps by a simpler one - complication usually being measured by the
                            state dimension;
                        </li>
                        <li class="itemize"><span class="cmti-10">implementation of the controller </span>where the controller has to be approximated in discrete-time to be implemented on physical hardware.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The first part of the course assumes precise knowledge of the structure and parameters of the dynamic systems investigated and precise measurements of the states for feedback control. In practice, such precise knowledge is seldom
                        available. Thus, it is important to be able to deal with random fluctuations in the environment and in the measurement system. The second part of the course thus is concerned with this topic, starting with a review of the fundamentals
                        of probability and random processes and proceeding to the design of the ”best” control system, on the average, using noisy measurements and taking into account random perturbations of the system by the environment.

                    <p>
                        There are tons of books (not to talk about papers) dealing with calculus of variations and optimal control design. Although some of them are excellent, navigating and combining the material for obtaining an appropriate
                        presentation level was definitely not trivial. I hope I did a good job but any suggestion is welcomed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The aim was to write lecture notes that were sufficiently self-contained so that any motivated student specializing in a technical subject should be able to follow them. Depending on the student’s background, some
                        supplementary reading may be necessary from time to time. The references at the end of each chapter should facilitate this.
                    </p>
                    <p>The exercises form an integral part of the text. They either illustrate the subject matter covered or extend it.</p>
                    <p>Problems at the end of each section are extensions and completions of theoretical material. The suggestion is to start working on each problem as soon as the corresponding material is covered.</p>
                    <p>Take care that, although great effort has been done in trying to remove errors in the text, some may still be present. Please report these errors.</p>
                    <p>
                        Not always are proper references given to sources from which results are taken. This does not mean that the results are original. In fact, all results presented in these notes (with the exception of some simple examples)
