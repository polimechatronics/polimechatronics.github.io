 id="x1-20001"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Over the past sixty years, a great body of knowledge has been built up on the subject
of feedback control systems for linear, time-invariant, single input and single output
dynamic systems. This knowledge plays an important role in our technology. The
primary aim of the designer using classical control design methods is to stabilize the
system/plant, whereas secondary aims may involve obtaining a certain transient
response, bandwidth, disturbance rejection, steady state error, and robustness to
plant variations or uncertainties. The designer’s methods are a combination of
analytical ones (e.g., Laplace transform, Routh test), graphical ones (e.g.,
Nyquist plots, Nichols charts), and a good deal of empirically based knowledge
(e.g., a certain class of compensator works satisfactorily for a certain class of
plants).
</p> 
<p>   For higher-order systems, multiple-input systems, or systems that do not
possess the properties usually assumed in the classical control approach
(linear and time invariant), the techniques for analysis and design of linear,
time-invariant systems are, in general, not applicable to these more complicated
systems.
</p> 
<p>   One of the main aims of modern control is to present solutions to a much wider
class of control problems than classical control can tackle by providing an array of
analytical design procedures that facilitate the design task.
</p> 
<p>   Optimal control is one particular branch of modem control that sets
out to design systems that are not supposed merely stable but satisfy, in
the best possible way, any one of the desirable constraints associated with
classical control. The problem of optimal control can then be stated as:
”Determine the control signals that will cause a system to satisfy the physical
constraints and, at the same time, minimize (or maximize) some performance
criterion”.
</p> 
<p>   After more than three hundred years of evolution of calculus of variations,
optimal control has developed into a well-established research area and finds its
applications in many scientific fields, ranging from mathematics and engineering to
biomedical and management sciences. As for modern control theory, despite the
development of a vast body of knowledge and despite some spectacular applications
to practical situations, some of the theory has yet to find application, and many
practical control problems have yet to find a theory that will successfully deal with
them.
</p> 
<p>   In particular, from the theoretical point of view, the existence problem of an
optimal control has still to be solved for many classes of problems. Note that solving
this problem is of crucial importance, since it does not make much sense to seek a
solution if none exists.
</p> 
<p>   Another important topic is to actually find an optimal control, i.e., give a ’recipe’
for operating the system in such a way that it satisfies the constraints in an optimal
manner. Such recipe should start from necessary and/or sufficient conditions for
optimality that are instrumental for identifying a small class of candidates for an
optimal control. Unfortunately, these conditions are not available for some classes of
problems.
</p> 
<p>   Finally, once a good candidate for an optimal control has been sorted out,
it has to be computed. As most real-world problems are too complex to
allow for an analytical solution, computational algorithms are inevitable in
solving optimal control problems. As a result, several successful families of
algorithms have been developed over the years. Research is still going on in trying
                                                                  

                                                                  
to speed up codes as well as in including special constraints (e.g. integer
constrains).

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-30001.1"></a>Lecture notes layout</h3>
<p>The course aims at providing the students with all necessary tools for being able to
apply the theory to practical optimal control design problems.
</p> 
<p>   Optimal control design is based on the designer’s familiarity with the
engineering situation and understanding of the underlying physics. These allow to
formulate a relevant mathematical model based on which the optimal control is
designed.
</p> 
<p>   There are four essential steps in an optimal control design: </p> 

     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmti-10">full-state feedback design </span>where it is assumed that all states are measured
     and available for feedback;
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmti-10">state estimator design </span>where the concern is to estimate values of the states
     when they cannot all be measured directly, but certain measurements are
     available;
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmti-10">controller reduction </span>where the concern is to approximate a complicated
     state estimate feedback controller obtained from the above two steps by a
     simpler one - complication usually being measured by the state dimension;
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmti-10">implementation  of  the  controller   </span>where  the  controller  has  to  be
     approximated in discrete-time to be implemented on physical hardware.</li></ul>
<p>   The first part of the course assumes precise knowledge of the structure and
parameters of the dynamic systems investigated and precise measurements of the
states for feedback control. In practice, such precise knowledge is seldom available.
Thus, it is important to be able to deal with random fluctuations in the environment
and in the measurement system. The second part of the course thus is concerned with
this topic, starting with a review of the fundamentals of probability and random
processes and proceeding to the design of the ”best” control system, on the average,
using noisy measurements and taking into account random perturbations of the
system by the environment.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-40001.2"></a>Pre-requisites for the course</h3>
<p>The background assumed of any student is: </p> 

     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">an elementary introduction to linear algebra.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">an elementary knowledge of mechanics and ordinary differential equations;
                                                                  

                                                                  
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">an elementary control course, covering such notions as transfer functions,
     Nyquist plots, root locus, etc.;
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">an elementary introduction to the state-space description of linear systems
     and</li></ul>
<p>
   </p> 

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-50001.3"></a>Final Remarks</h3>
<p>There are tons of books (not to talk about papers) dealing with calculus of
variations and optimal control design. Although some of them are excellent,
navigating and combining the material for obtaining an appropriate presentation
level was definitely not trivial. I hope I did a good job but any suggestion is
welcomed.
</p> 
<p>   The aim was to write lecture notes that were sufficiently self-contained so that
any motivated student specializing in a technical subject should be able to follow
them. Depending on the student’s background, some supplementary reading may be
necessary from time to time. The references at the end of each chapter should
facilitate this.
</p> 
<p>   The exercises form an integral part of the text. They either illustrate the subject
matter covered or extend it.
</p> 
<p>   Problems at the end of each section are extensions and completions of theoretical
material. The suggestion is to start working on each problem as soon as the
corresponding material is covered.
</p> 
<p>   Take care that, although great effort has been done in trying to remove errors in
the text, some may still be present. Please report these errors.
</p> 
<p>   Not always are proper references given to sources from which results are taken.
This does not mean that the results are original. In fact, all results presented in these
notes (with the exception of some simple examples) were borrowed from the
literature.

<p>   The purpose of this chapter is to provide some background on the <span 
class="cmti-10">nonlinear</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">programming (NLP) problem</span>. Indeed, an exhaustive discussion of both theoretical
and practical aspects of nonlinear programming can be the subject matter of an
entire book.
</p> 
<p>   There are several reasons for studying nonlinear programming in an optimal
control class:
   </p> 

     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">anyone  interested  in  optimal  control  should  know  about  a  number  of
     fundamental results in nonlinear programming; in fact, as optimal control
     problems are optimization problems in (infinite-dimensional) functional
     spaces while NLP problems are optimization problems in Euclidean spaces,
     optimal control can be seen as a generalization of nonlinear programming;
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">NLP techniques are used routinely and are particularly efficient in solving
     optimal control problems (in the case of a discrete control problem, i.e.
     when  the  controls  are  exerted  at  discrete  points,  the  problem  can  be
     directly stated as a NLP problem; in a continuous control problem, on
     the other hand, i.e. when the controls are functions to be exerted over
     a prescribed planning horizon, an approximate solution can be found by
     solving a NLP problem).</li></ul>

<p>Note also that the set <!--l. 111--><math

typically includes lower and upper bounds on the variables. The reason for
separating variable bounds from the other inequality constraints is that they can
play a useful role in some algorithms, i.e. they are handled in a specific
way.</p>

<p>   The graphical approach used in the above example, i.e. find an optimal solution
by determining the objective contour with the smallest objective value that intersects
the feasible region, is only suitable for small problems. It becomes intractable for
problems containing contours of the objective function in more than three
variables as well as for problems having complicated objective and/or constraint
functions.

<p>   This chapter is organized as follows:
   </p> 

     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">we start by defining what is meant by optimality and give conditions under
     which a minimum (or a maximum) exists for a nonlinear program;
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">then, we discuss the special properties of convex programs;
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">then, both necessary and sufficient conditions of optimality are presented
     for NLP problems;
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">successively,   we   consider   unconstrained   problems,   problems   with
     inequality constraints, and problems with both equality and inequality
     constraints;
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">finally, several numerical optimization techniques will be presented, which
     are instrumental to solve a great variety of NLP problems.</li></ul>

<p>A variety of different definitions of optimality are used in different contexts. It is
important to understand fully each definition and the context within which it is
appropriately used.

the nature of their definition in terms of local information, are much more convenient
to locate with an algorithm.

<p>   In convex programming, any local minimum is therefore a globall minimum. This
is a powerful result that makes any local optimization algorithm a global
optimization algorithm when applied to a convex optimization problem. Yet, theorem
<a 
href="#x1-13002r2">2.2<!--tex4ht:ref: teoCnvxMin --></a> only gives a sufficient condition for that property to hold. That is, a nonlinear
program with nonconvex participating functions may not necessarily have local
minima that are not global minima.

<p>   The convexity condition required by theorem <a 
href="#x1-14017r5">2.5<!--tex4ht:ref: teo1SufCond --></a> is actually very restrictive, in
the sense that many practical problems are nonconvex. In theorem <a 
href="#x1-14021r8">2.8<!--tex4ht:ref: teo2SufCond --></a>, we give
sufficient conditions for characterizing a local minimum point, provided the objective
function is strictly convex in a neighborhood of that point.

<p>One of the major difficulties in applying the foregoing result is that we do not know a
priori which constraints are active and which constraints are inactive, i.e., the active
set is unknown. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate all possible active sets for

<span

Note, however, that the Lagrange multipliers are guaranteed to be unique if LICQ
holds (as stated in Theorem <a

MFCQ.</p>

In other words, the geometric conditions developed in the previous section for
inequality constrained problems are satisfied by all feasible solutions and, hence, are
not informative. A different approach must therefore be used to deal with equality
constrained problems. After a number of preliminary results in <a 
href="#x1-190002.7.1">2.7.1<!--tex4ht:ref: subsecProblmEqConstrPrel --></a>, we shall
describe the method of Lagrange multipliers for equality constrained problems in

Hence, these conditions are complete in the sense that they determine, at least
locally, a unique solution. However, as in the unconstrained case, a solution to the
first-order necessary conditions need not be a (local) minimum of the original
problem; it could very well correspond to a (local) maximum point, or some
kind of saddle point. These consideration are illustrated in Example <a 
href="#x1-20009r15">2.15<!--tex4ht:ref: ref_reg --></a>
below.</p>

</p> 
<p>It is important to note that for a local minimum to satisfy the foregoing first-order
conditions and, in particular, for a unique Lagrange multiplier vector to exist, it is
necessary that the equality constraint satisfy a regularity condition. In other word,
the first-order conditions may not hold at a local minimum point that is
non-regular. An illustration of these considerations is provided in Example
<a 
href="#x1-20010r16">2.16<!--tex4ht:ref: non_ref_reg --></a>.
</p> 
<p>There exists a number of similarities with the constraint qualification needed for a
local minimizer of an inequality constrained NLP problem to be KKT point; in
particular, the condition that the minimum point be a regular point for the
constraints corresponds to LICQ (see Remark <a 
href="#x1-17018r21">2.21<!--tex4ht:ref: constrQual --></a>).</p>

<p>   The conditions given in Theorems <a 
href="#x1-20002r13">2.13<!--tex4ht:ref: fonceq --></a> and <a 
href="#x1-20013r15">2.15<!--tex4ht:ref: SONC --></a> are necessary conditions that
must hold at each local minimum point. Yet, a point satisfying these conditions may
not be a local minimum. The following theorem provides sufficient conditions for a
stationary point of the Lagrangian function to be a (local) minimum, provided that
the Hessian matrix of the Lagrangian function is locally convex along directions in
the tangent space of the constraints.

<p>The concept of Lagrange multipliers allows to adjoin the constraints to the objective
function. That is, one can view constrained optimization as a search for a vector

of constraints.

case, the positivity of the Lagrange multipliers follows from the fact that by increasing
<!--l. 1820--><math

feasible region is relaxed, hence the optimal cost cannot increase. Regarding inactive
constraints, the sensitivity interpretation also explains why the Lagrange multipliers
are zero, as any infinitesimal change in the value of these constraints leaves the
optimal cost value unchanged.</p>

. The magnitude of this force depends on how much the gravitational force
is pushing against the constraint. The static equilibrium condition is

On the other hand, inequality constraints can be seen as barriers, the ball
is forced to lie inside these barriers. Consider the inequality constraint
<!--l. 1826--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mi 
>g</mi><mo

constraint is inactive, it is not exerting any force on the ball and hence it is not affecting the
equilibrium equation. When the constraint is active, the direction of the force exerted is
<!--l. 1826--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"

>g</mi><mo 
class="MathClass-open">(</mo><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi 
>x</mi></mstyle><mo 
class="MathClass-close">)</mo></math>.Compared
to rails, barriers are unilateral constraints and can only exert forces in one sense. This is
the physical interpretation of the nonnegativity of its associated Lagrangian multipliers

The equilibrium equation in presence of both equality and inequality
constraints become the first KKT condition. This interpretation
is illustrated in Figure <a

<p>   Overall, these results thus constitute the KKT optimality conditions as stated in
Theorem <a 
href="#x1-17014r10">2.10<!--tex4ht:ref: teoKKTneccond --></a>. But although the foregoing development is straightforward, it is
somewhat limited by the regularity-type assumption at the optimal solution.
Obtaining more general constraint qualifications (see Remark <a 
href="#x1-17018r21">2.21<!--tex4ht:ref: constrQual --></a>) requires that the
KKT conditions be derived using an alternative approach, e.g., the approach
described earlier in Section <a 
href="#x1-150002.6">2.6<!--tex4ht:ref: sectIneqProblm --></a>. Still, the conversion to equality constrained problem
proves useful in many situations, e.g., for deriving second-order sufficiency conditions
for inequality constrained NLP problems.

<p>   Farkas’ Theorem is used extensively in the derivation of optimality conditions of
(linear and) nonlinear programming problems. A geometrical interpretation of
Farkas’ Theorem is shown in Fig. 1.A.1.. If a1, . . . , am denote the rows
of A, then system 2 has a solution if c lies in the convex cone generated
by a1, . . . , am; On the other hand, system 1 has a solution if the closed
convex cone x : Ax 0 and the open half-space x : cTx ¿ 0 have a nonempty
intersection.

<p>Nowadays, strong and efficient mathematical programming techniques are available
for solving a great variety of nonlinear problems, which are based on solid theoretical
results and extensive numerical studies. Approximated functions, derivatives and
optimal solutions can be employed together with optimization algorithms to
reduce the computational time. The aim of this section is not to describe
state-of-the-art algorithms in nonlinear programming, but to explain, in a simple
way, a number of modern algorithms for solving nonlinear problems. These
techniques are typically iterative in the sense that, given an initial point

, is obtained by repeated application of an algorithmic rule.
The objective is to make this sequence converge to a point

pre-specified <span 
class="cmti-10">solution set</span>. Typically, the solution set is specified in terms of
optimality conditions, such as those presented in <a

href="#x1-210002.8">2.8<!--tex4ht:ref: GenNLPProblm --></a>.

<p>   We start by recalling a number of concepts in <a

principles of Newton-like algorithms for nonlinear systems in <a 
href="#x1-260002.9.2">2.9.2<!--tex4ht:ref: N_alg_nl --></a>, and use these
concepts for the solution of unconstrained optimization problems in <a 
href="#x1-270002.9.3">2.9.3<!--tex4ht:ref: Unc_optl --></a>. Finally,
algorithms for solving general nonlinear problems are presented in <a 
href="#x1-310002.9.7">2.9.7<!--tex4ht:ref: ConstrNLOPTl --></a>, with
emphasizes on sequential unconstrained minimization (SUM) and sequential
quadratic programming (SQP) techniques.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.9.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-250002.9.1"></a>Preliminaries</h4>
<p>Two essential questions must be addressed concerning iterative algorithms. The first
question, which is qualitative in nature, is whether a given algorithm in some
sense yields, at least in the limit, a solution to the original problem; the
second question, the more quantitative one, is concerned with how fast the
algorithm converges to a solution. We elaborate on these concepts in this
subsection.
</p> 
<p>   The convergence of an algorithm is said to be <span 
class="cmti-10">asymptotic </span>when the solution is not
achieved after a finite number of iterations; except for particular problems such as
linear and quadratic programming, this is generally the case in nonlinear
programming. That is, a very desirable property of an optimization algorithm is
global convergence:

<p>   Most modern mathematical programming algorithms are globally convergent.
Locally convergent algorithms are not useful in practice because the neighborhood of
convergence is not known in advance and can be arbitrarily small.
</p> 
<p>   Next, what distinguishes optimization algorithms with the global convergence
property is the order of convergence:

measure of the asymptotic rate of convergence, i.e., as the iterates gets close
to the solution; yet, a sequence with a good order of convergence may be
very ”slow” far from the solution. Clearly, the convergence is faster when
<!--l. 36--><math

smaller. Near the solution, if the convergence rate is linear, then the error is multiplied
by <!--l. 36--><math

iteration roughly doubles the number of significant digits. The methods that
will be studied hereafter have convergence rates varying between linear and
quadratic.

<p>   It should also be noted that for most algorithms, the user must set initial values
for certain parameters, such as the starting point and the initial step size, as well as
parameters for terminating the algorithm. Optimization procedures are often quite
sensitive to these parameters, and may produce different results, or even stop
prematurely, depending on their values. Therefore, it is crucial for the user to
understand the principles of the algorithms used, so that he or she can select
adequate values for the parameters and diagnose the reasons of a premature
termination (failure).

<p>   It can be shown that the rate of convergence for Newton’s method is quadratic
(see Definition <a 
href="#x1-25002r24">2.24<!--tex4ht:ref: OfC --></a>). Loosely speaking, it implies that each successive estimate of the
solution doubles the number significant digits, which is a very desirable property for
an algorithm to possess.

close to the solution, i.e., within the region of convergence, Newton’s method may
diverge. Said differently, Newton’s method as presented above does not have the global
convergence property (see Definition <a

singular during the iteration process, since the correction defined by the Newton’s algorithm

are required at each iteration. With the objective of reducing the computational
effort, quasi-Newton methods generate an approximation of the Jacobian matrix,
based on the information gathered from the iteration progress. To avoid solving a
linear system for the search direction, variants of quasi-Newton methods also
exist that generate an approximation of the inverse of the Jacobian matrix.

<p>Many unconstrained optimization algorithms work along the same lines. Starting
from an initial point, a direction of movement is determined according to a fixed rule,
and then a move is made in that direction so that the objective function value is
reduced; at the new point, a new direction is determined and the process is repeated.
The main difference between these algorithms rest with the rule by which successive
directions of movement are selected. A distinction is usually made between
those algorithms which determine the search direction <span 
class="cmti-10">without </span>using gradient
information (gradient-free methods), and those using gradient (and higher-order
derivatives) information (gradient-based methods). Here, we shall focus our
attention on the latter class of methods, and more specifically on Newton-like
algorithms.
</p> 
<p>   Throughout this subsection, we shall assume that the objective function
<!--l. 189--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mi

twice continuously differentiable. By theorem <a

is <!--l. 189--><math

Hence, the idea is to devise an iterative scheme that finds a point
satisfying the foregoing condition. Following the techniques discussed
earlier in <a 
href="#x1-260002.9.2">2.9.2<!--tex4ht:ref: N_alg_nl --></a>, this can be done by using a Newton-like algorithm, with

based on finding a zero of the gradient vector, there is no guarantee that

downhill, i.e., the following descent condition should be satisfied at each

<p>   We now discuss two important improvements to Newton’s method, which are
directly related to the issues discussed in Subsection <a 
href="#x1-260002.9.2">2.9.2<!--tex4ht:ref: N_alg_nl --></a>, namely (i) the lack of
global convergence, and (ii) computational efficiency.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.9.4   </span> <a 
 id="x1-280002.9.4"></a>Globalization Strategies</h4>
<p>Up to this point, the development has focused on the application of Newton’s
method. However, even in the simplest one-dimensional applications, Newton’s
method has deficiencies (see, e.g., Example <a 
href="#x1-26004r20">2.20<!--tex4ht:ref: ex_1.69 --></a>). Methods for correcting global
convergence deficiencies are referred to as globalization strategies. It should be
stressed than an efficient globalization strategy should only alter the iterates when a
problem is encountered, but it should not impede the ultimate behavior of the
method, i.e., the quadratic convergence of a Newton’s method should be
retained.
</p> 
<p>   In unconstrained optimization, one can detect problems in
a very simple fashion, by monitoring whether the next iterate
<!--l. 225--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi 
>x</mi><msup><mrow 
></mstyle></mrow><mrow 
><mi 
>k</mi><mo 
class="MathClass-bin">+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup 
></math>
satisfies a descent condition with respect to the actual iterate
<!--l. 225--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi 
>x</mi><msup><mrow 
></mstyle></mrow><mrow 
><mi 
>k</mi></mrow></msup 
></math>, e.g.,
<!--l. 225--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mi 
>f</mi><mo 
class="MathClass-open">(</mo><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi

><mi

><mo 
class="MathClass-close">)</mo></math>.
Then, either one of two globalization strategies can be used to correct the Newton
step. The first strategy, known as line search method, is to alter the magnitude of the
step; the second one, known as trust region method, is to modify both the step
magnitude and direction. We shall only concentrate on the former class of
globalization strategies subsequently.

<p>   A line search method proceeds by replacing the <span

The resulting minimization problem can be solved by any one-dimensional <span 
class="cmti-10">exact</span>
minimization technique (e.g., Newton’s method itself). However, such techniques are
costly in the sense that they often require many iterations to converge and, therefore,
many function (or even gradient) evaluations.
</p> 
<p>   In response to this, most modern algorithms implement so-called inexact line
search criteria, which aim to find a step-length giving an ”acceptable” decrease in the
objective function. Note that sacrificing accuracy, we might impair the convergence of
the overall algorithm that iteratively employs such a line search. However,
by adopting a line search that guarantees a sufficient degree of descent in
the objective function, the convergence of the overall algorithm can still be
established.
</p> 
<p>   We now describe one popular definition of an acceptable step-length known as
Armijo’s rule. Other popular approaches are the quadratic and cubic fit techniques,
as well as Wolfe’s and Glodstein’s tests. Armijo’s rule is driven by two parameters

<p>Another limitation of Newton’s method when applied to unconstrained optimization
problems is that the Hessian matrix of the objective function is needed at each
iteration, then a linear system must be solved for obtaining the search direction. For
many applications, this can be a costly computational burden. In response to this,
quasi-Newton methods attempt to construct this information recursively. However,
by so doing, the quadratic rate of convergence is lost.

<p>   Many modern deterministic algorithms for constrained NLP problems are
based on the (rather natural) principle that, instead of solving a difficult
problem directly, one had better solve a sequence of simpler, but related,
subproblems, which converges to a solution of the original problem either
in a finite number of steps or in the limit. Working along these lines, two
classes of algorithms can be distinguished for solution of NLP problems with
equality and/or inequality constraints. On the one hand, penalty function
and interior-point methods consist of solving the problem as a sequence
of unconstrained problems (or problems with simple constraints), so that
algorithms for unconstrained optimization can be used. These methods, which do
not rely on the KKT theory described earlier in <a 
href="#x1-150002.6">2.6<!--tex4ht:ref: sectIneqProblm --></a> through <a 
href="#x1-210002.8">2.8<!--tex4ht:ref: GenNLPProblm --></a>, shall be
briefly presented in <a 
href="#x1-320002.9.8">2.9.8<!--tex4ht:ref: penFun --></a> and <a 
href="#x1-330002.9.9">2.9.9<!--tex4ht:ref: IPmethd --></a>. On the other hand, Newton-like methods
solve NLP problems by attempting to find a point satisfying the necessary
conditions of optimality (KKT conditions in general). Sequential quadratic
programming (SQP), which shall be presented in <a 
href="#x1-340002.9.10">2.9.10<!--tex4ht:ref: SQP --></a>, represents one such class of
methods.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.9.8   </span> <a 
 id="x1-320002.9.8"></a>Penalty Function Methods</h4>
<p>Methods using penalty functions transform a constrained problem into a single
unconstrained problem or a sequence of unconstrained problems. This is done by
placing the constraints into the objective function via a penalty parameter in a way
that penalizes any violation of the constraints. To illustrate it, consider the NLP
problem:

<p>   Note that the assumption that <!--l. 440--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mi 
>X</mi></math>
is compact is necessary, for it possible that the optimal objective values of the
original and penalty problems are not equal otherwise. Yet, this assumption is not
very restrictive in most practical cases as the variables usually lie between
finite upper and lower bounds. Note also that no restriction is imposed on
<!--l. 440--><math

functions (see <a

<p>   From a computational viewpoint, superlinear convergence rates might be
achievable, in principle, by applying Newton’s method (or its variants such as
quasi-Newton methods). Yet, one can expect ill-conditioning problems when
<!--l. 461--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mi 
>μ</mi></math>
is taken very large in the penalty problem. With a large
<!--l. 461--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mi 
>μ</mi></math>, more
emphasis is placed on feasibility, and most procedures for unconstrained optimization
will move quickly towards a feasible point. Even though this point may be far
from the optimum, both slow convergence and premature termination can
occur due to very small step size and finite precision computations (round-off
errors).
</p> 
<p>   As a result of the above mentioned difficulties associated with large penalty
parameters, most algorithms using penalty functions employ a sequence of increasing
penalty parameters. With each new value of the penalty parameter, an optimization
technique is employed, starting with the optimal solution corresponding to the
previously chosen parameters value. Such an approach is often referred to
as sequential unconstrained minimization (SUM) technique. This way, a
sequence of infeasible points is typically generated, whose limit is an optimal
solution to the original problem (hence the term <span 
class="cmti-10">exterior penalty function</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">approach</span>).
</p> 
<p>   To conclude our discussion on the penalty function approach, we give an algorithm to
solve a general NLP problem, where the penalty function used are of the form specified
by <!--l. 465--><math

<p>Similar to penalty functions, <span

constrained problem into an unconstrained problem (or into a sequence of
unconstrained problems). These functions act as a barrier and prevent the iterates
from leaving the feasible region. If the optimal solution occurs at the boundary of the
feasible domain, the procedure moves from the interior to the boundary of the
domain, hence the name interior-point methods. To illustrate these methods, consider

optimal solution. As in the exterior penalty function approach, it is highly
recommended to use suitable second-order Newton or quasi-Newton methods for
solving the successive barrier problems.

may be ignored, it is considered in the problem formulation as most line search
methods use discrete steps, and a step could lead to a point outside the feasible
region (where the value of the barrier function is a large negative number), when
close to the boundary. Therefore, the problem can effectively be treated as an
unconstrained optimization problem only if an explicit check for feasibility is
made.
</p> 
<p>   In recent years, there has been much excitement because some variants of the
interior-point algorithm can be shown to be polynomial in time for many classes of
<span 
class="cmti-10">convex </span>programs. Moreover, interior-point codes are now proving to be highly
competitive with codes based on other algorithms, such as SQP algorithms presented
subsequently. A number of free and commercial interior-point solvers are given in
Tab. 1.1. below.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.9.10   </span> <a 
 id="x1-340002.9.10"></a>Sequential Quadratic Programming</h4>
<p>Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods, also known as successive, or
recursive, quadratic programming, employ Newton’s method (or quasi-Newton
methods) to directly solve the KKT conditions for the original problem. As a result,
the accompanying subproblem turns out to be the minimization of a quadratic
approximation to the Lagrangian function subject to a linear approximation to the
constraints. Hence, this type of process is also known as a projected Lagrangian, or
the Newton-Lagrange, approach. By its nature, this method produces both primal
and dual (Lagrange multiplier) solutions.
</p> 
<p>   To present the concept of SQP, consider first the equality constrained nonlinear
program:

     <p>It can be shown that this modification to the rudimentary SQP algorithm,
     similar to the quasi-Newton modification of Newton’s algorithm, looses the
     quadratic convergence rate property. Instead, it can be shown that the
     convergence is superlinear when initialized sufficiently close to a solution

What Can Go Wrong?
</p> 
<p>   The material presented up to this point was intended to give the reader an
understanding of how SQP methods should work. Things do not go so smoothly in
practice though. We now discuss a number of common difficulties that can be
encountered, and suggest remedial actions to correct the deficiencies. Because real
applications may involve more than a single difficulty, the user must be prepared to
correct all problems before obtaining satisfactory performance from an optimization
software.

     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><strong><span 
class="cmbx-10">Infeasible Constraints</span></strong>
     <p>One  of  the  most  common  difficulties  occurs  when  the  NLP  problem
     has  infeasible  constraints,  i.e.,  the  constraints  taken  all  together  have
     <span 
class="cmti-10">no  </span>solution. Applying general-purpose SQP software to such problems
     typically produces one or more of the following symptoms:
     </p> 

         <ul class="itemize2">
         <li class="itemize">one of the QP subproblem happen to be infeasible, which occurs when
         the linearized constraints have no solution;
         </li>
         <li class="itemize">many NLP iterations produce very little progress;
         </li>
         <li class="itemize">the penalty parameters <!--l. 896--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mi 
>μ</mi></math>
         of the merit functions growsvery large;
         </li>
         <li class="itemize">the Lagrange multipliers become very large.
         </li></ul>
     <p>Although robust SQP software attempt to diagnose this situation, ultimately
     the only remedy is to reformulate the NLP.
     </p> 
</li>
     <li class="itemize"><strong><span 
class="cmbx-10">Rank-Deficient Constraints</span></strong>
     <p>In contrast to the previous situation, it is possible that the constraints
     be consistent, but the Jacobian matrix of the active constraints, at
     the solution point, be either ill-conditioned or rank deficient. This
                                                                  

                                                                  
     situation was illustrated in Examples 1.43 and 1.55. The application
     of general-purpose SQP software is likely to produce the following
     symptoms:
     </p> 

         <ul class="itemize2">
         <li class="itemize">many NLP iterations produce very little progress;
         </li>
         <li class="itemize">the penalty parameters <!--l. 909--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mi 
>μ</mi></math>
         of the merit functions grows very large;
         </li>
         <li class="itemize">the Lagrange multipliers become very large;
         </li>
         <li class="itemize">the  rank  deficiency  in  the  Jacobian  of  the  active  constraints  is
         detected.
         </li></ul>
     <p>Note that many symptoms of rank-deficient constraints are the same as those of
     inconsistent constraints. It is therefore quite common to confuse this deficiency
     with inconsistent constraints. Again, the remedy is to reformulate the
     problem.
     </p> 
</li>
     <li class="itemize"><strong><span 
class="cmbx-10">Redundant Constraints</span></strong>
     <p>A third type of difficulty occurs when the NLP problem contains redundant
     constraints. Two types of redundancy may be distinguished. In the first type,
     some of the constraints are unnecessary to the problem formulation, which
     typically results in the following symptoms:
     </p> 

         <ul class="itemize2">
         <li class="itemize">the Lagrange multipliers are close to zero;
         </li>
         <li class="itemize">the solver has difficulty in detecting the active set.</li></ul>
     <p>In the second type, the redundant constraints give rise to rank deficiency, and
     the problem then exhibits symptoms similar to the rank-deficient case discussed
     previously. Obviously, the remedy is to reformulate the problem by eliminating
     the redundant constraints.
     </p> 
</li>
     <li class="itemize"><strong><span 
class="cmbx-10">Discontinuities</span></strong>
     <p>Perhaps the biggest obstacle encountered in the practical application of
     SQP methods (as well as many other NLP methods including SUM
     techniques) is the presence of discontinuous behavior. All of the numerical
     methods described herein assume continuous and differentiable objective
     function and constraints. Yet, there are many common examples of
     discontinuous functions in practice, including: IF tests in codes; absolute value,
     <!--l. 931--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mi class="qopname">min</mi><mo> &ApplyFunction;<!--FUNCTION APPLICATION--> </mo></math>, and
     <!--l. 931--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mi class="qopname">max</mi><mo> &ApplyFunction;<!--FUNCTION APPLICATION--> </mo></math>
                                                                  

                                                                  
     functions; linear interpolation of data; internal iterations such as root finding;
     etc.
     </p> 
<p>Regarding SQP methods, the standard QP subproblems are no longer
     appropriate when discontinuities are present. In fact, the KKT necessary
     conditions simply do not apply! The most common symptoms of discontinuous
     functions are:
     </p> 

         <ul class="itemize2">
         <li class="itemize">the iterates converge slowly or, even, diverge;
         </li>
         <li class="itemize">the line search takes very small steps <!--l. 937--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mo 
class="MathClass-open">(</mo><mi 
>α</mi> <mo 
class="MathClass-rel">≈</mo> <mn>0</mn><mo 
class="MathClass-close">)</mo></math>;
         </li>
         <li class="itemize">the Hessian matrix becomes badly ill-conditioned.</li></ul>
     <p>The remedy consists in reformulating discontinuous problems into smooth
     problems: for absolute value, min, and max functions, tricks can be used that
     introduce slack variables and additional constraints; linear data interpolation
     can be replaced by higher order interpolation schemes that are continuous
     through second derivatives; internal iterations can also be handled via
     additional NLP constraints; etc.
     </p> 
</li>
     <li class="itemize"><strong><span 
class="cmbx-10">Inaccurate Gradient Estimation</span></strong>
     <p>Any SQP code requires that the user supply the objective function and
     constraint values, as well as their gradient (and possibly their Hessian too). In
     general, the user is proposed the option to calculate the gradients via finite
     differences, e.g.,
     </p>

</math></td></tr></table>
     <p>However, this may cause the problem to stop prematurely.
     First of all, the choice of the perturbation vector
     <!--l. 952--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mstyle mathvariant="bold-italic"><mi 
>δ</mi></mstyle><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi 
>x</mi></mstyle></math>
     is highly non trivial. If too large a value clearly provides inaccurate estimates,
     too small a value may also result in very bad estimates due to finite arithmetic
     precision computations. Therefore, one must try to find a trade-off between
                                                                  

                                                                  
     these two extreme situations. The difficulty stems from the fact that a trade-off
     may not necessarily exist if the requested accuracy for the gradient is too high.
     In other word, the error made in the finite-difference approximation of a
     gradient <span 
class="cmti-10">cannot </span>be made as small as desired. Further, the maximum accuracy
     that can be achieved with finite difference is both problem dependent
     (e.g., badly-scaled functions are more problematic than well-scaled
     functions) and machine dependent (e.g., double precision computations
     provides more accurate estimates than single precision computations).
     Typical symptoms of inaccurate gradient estimates in an SQP code
     are:
     </p> 

         <ul class="itemize2">
         <li class="itemize">the iterates converge slowly, and the solver may stop prematurely at
         a suboptimal point (jamming);
         </li>
         <li class="itemize">the line search takes very small steps <!--l. 956--><math

class="MathClass-open">(</mo><mi 
>α</mi> <mo 
class="MathClass-rel">≈</mo> <mn>0</mn><mo 
class="MathClass-close">)</mo></math>.</li></ul>
     <p>The situation can be understood as follows. Assume that the gradient estimate
     is contaminated with noise. Then, instead of computing the true value
     <!--l. 959--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"

     get <!--l. 959--><math

     But since the iteration seeks a point such that
     <!--l. 959--><math

display="inline" ><mi

     we can expect either a degraded rate of convergence or, worse, no
     convergence at all, because ultimately the gradient will be dominated by
     noise.
     </p> 
<p>To avoid these problems, the user should always consider providing the
     gradients explicitely to the SQP solver, instead of relying on finite-difference
     estimates. For large-scale problems, this is obviously a time-consuming and
     error-prone task. In response to this, efficient <span 
class="cmti-10">algorithmic differentiation </span>tools
     (also called automatic differentiation) have been developed within the
     last fifteen years. The idea behind it is that, given a piece of program
     calculating a number of function values (e.g., in fortran77 or C language), an
     auxiliary program is generated that calculates the derivatives of these
     functions.

     <p>Scaling affects everything! Poor scaling can make a good algorithm behave

     . The idea is to let the optimization algorithm work with the well-scaled
     quantities in order to improve performance. However, what well-scaled
     quantities mean is hard to define, although conventional wisdom suggests the
     following hints:
