<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Over the past sixty years, a great body of knowledge has been built up on the subject
of feedback control systems for linear, time-invariant, single input and single output
dynamic systems. This knowledge plays an important role in our technology. The
primary aim of the designer using classical control design methods is to stabilize the
system/plant, whereas secondary aims may involve obtaining a certain transient
response, bandwidth, disturbance rejection, steady state error, and robustness to
plant variations or uncertainties. The designer&#8217;s methods are a combination of
analytical ones (e.g., Laplace transform, Routh test), graphical ones (e.g.,
Nyquist plots, Nichols charts), and a good deal of empirically based knowledge
(e.g., a certain class of compensator works satisfactorily for a certain class of
plants).
</p><!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >   For higher-order systems, multiple-input systems, or systems that do not
possess the properties usually assumed in the classical control approach
(linear and time invariant), the techniques for analysis and design of linear,
time-invariant systems are, in general, not applicable to these more complicated
systems.
</p><!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >   One of the main aims of modern control is to present solutions to a much wider
class of control problems than classical control can tackle by providing an array of
analytical design procedures that facilitate the design task.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   Optimal control is one particular branch of modem control that sets
out to design systems that are not supposed merely stable but satisfy, in
the best possible way, any one of the desirable constraints associated with
classical control. The problem of optimal control can then be stated as:
&#8221;Determine the control signals that will cause a system to satisfy the physical
constraints and, at the same time, minimize (or maximize) some performance
criterion&#8221;.
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   After more than three hundred years of evolution of calculus of variations,
optimal control has developed into a well-established research area and finds its
applications in many scientific fields, ranging from mathematics and engineering to
biomedical and management sciences. As for modern control theory, despite the
development of a vast body of knowledge and despite some spectacular applications
to practical situations, some of the theory has yet to find application, and many
practical control problems have yet to find a theory that will successfully deal with
them.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   In particular, from the theoretical point of view, the existence problem of an
optimal control has still to be solved for many classes of problems. Note that solving
this problem is of crucial importance, since it does not make much sense to seek a
solution if none exists.
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   Another important topic is to actually find an optimal control, i.e., give a &#8217;recipe&#8217;
for operating the system in such a way that it satisfies the constraints in an optimal
manner. Such recipe should start from necessary and/or sufficient conditions for
optimality that are instrumental for identifying a small class of candidates for an
optimal control. Unfortunately, these conditions are not available for some classes of
problems.
</p><!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >   Finally, once a good candidate for an optimal control has been sorted out,
it has to be computed. As most real-world problems are too complex to
allow for an analytical solution, computational algorithms are inevitable in
solving optimal control problems. As a result, several successful families of
algorithms have been developed over the years. Research is still going on in trying
                                                                  

                                                                  
to speed up codes as well as in including special constraints (e.g. integer
constrains).

<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >The course aims at providing the students with all necessary tools for being able to
apply the theory to practical optimal control design problems.
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   Optimal control design is based on the designer&#8217;s familiarity with the
engineering situation and understanding of the underlying physics. These allow to
formulate a relevant mathematical model based on which the optimal control is
designed.
</p><!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   There are four essential steps in an optimal control design: </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmti-10">full-state feedback design </span>where it is assumed that all states are measured
     and available for feedback;
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmti-10">state estimator design </span>where the concern is to estimate values of the states
     when they cannot all be measured directly, but certain measurements are
     available;
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmti-10">controller reduction </span>where the concern is to approximate a complicated
     state estimate feedback controller obtained from the above two steps by a
     simpler one - complication usually being measured by the state dimension;
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmti-10">implementation  of  the  controller   </span>where  the  controller  has  to  be
     approximated in discrete-time to be implemented on physical hardware.</li></ul>
<!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   The first part of the course assumes precise knowledge of the structure and
parameters of the dynamic systems investigated and precise measurements of the
states for feedback control. In practice, such precise knowledge is seldom available.
Thus, it is important to be able to deal with random fluctuations in the environment
and in the measurement system. The second part of the course thus is concerned with
this topic, starting with a review of the fundamentals of probability and random
processes and proceeding to the design of the &#8221;best&#8221; control system, on the average,
using noisy measurements and taking into account random perturbations of the
system by the environment.

 id="x1-50001.3"></a>Final Remarks</h3>
<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" >There are tons of books (not to talk about papers) dealing with calculus of
variations and optimal control design. Although some of them are excellent,
navigating and combining the material for obtaining an appropriate presentation
level was definitely not trivial. I hope I did a good job but any suggestion is
welcomed.
</p><!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   The aim was to write lecture notes that were sufficiently self-contained so that
any motivated student specializing in a technical subject should be able to follow
them. Depending on the student&#8217;s background, some supplementary reading may be
necessary from time to time. The references at the end of each chapter should
facilitate this.
</p><!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   The exercises form an integral part of the text. They either illustrate the subject
matter covered or extend it.
</p><!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   Problems at the end of each section are extensions and completions of theoretical
material. The suggestion is to start working on each problem as soon as the
corresponding material is covered.
</p><!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >   Take care that, although great effort has been done in trying to remove errors in
the text, some may still be present. Please report these errors.
</p><!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >   Not always are proper references given to sources from which results are taken.
This does not mean that the results are original. In fact, all results presented in these
notes (with the exception of some simple examples) were borrowed from the
literature.
